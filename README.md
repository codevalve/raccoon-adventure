# 🦝 Raccoon Adventure

**Genre:** Suburban Wildlife Shenanigans  
**Tagline:** *When the moon is up, the trash is fair game.*

---

You are a raccoon. Not just any raccoon—**the** raccoon.  
Your mission?  

- **Find food** (preferably stolen)  
- **Find a mate** (love is in the garbage-strewn air)  
- **Cause mischief** (because you can)

Set in the sprawling, cinematic world of a **typical suburban backyard**, you’ll roam among trees, fences, and mysterious human artifacts. Every overturned flower pot is a clue; every suspicious grill might hide your next snack.

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Arrow Keys** → Move your furry little legs  
- **Space** → Jump (onto tables, fences… maybe into trouble)  
- **B** → Bite (trash bags, sprinklers, unsuspecting lawn gnomes)  
- **T** → Touch (because sometimes gentle chaos is the best chaos)

## 🏆 Your Goals

1. Eat something that was *absolutely* not left out for you.  
2. Woo another raccoon with your daring antics.  
3. Cause a chain reaction of suburban panic worthy of the neighborhood Facebook group.

## 🌳 The World

Think *Untitled Goose Game*, but swap the goose for a wily raccoon and the quaint village for a yard lit by motion-activated floodlights.

Every shadow could hide a snack. Every snack could lead to trouble. And trouble?  
That’s where you shine.

*Disclaimer: No actual trash pandas were harmed in the making of this game.  
Though several plastic bins were permanently “modified.”*
